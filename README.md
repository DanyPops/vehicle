# Vehicle workspace

A runtime-neutral Vehicle SDK for agent tools (`@danypops/vehicle-*`), as a
Bun workspace of independently versioned, independently publishable packages
under `packages/*`. A Vehicle is a long-running service purpose-built to
serve AI agents tools -- so the daemon substrate (process lifecycle, storage,
auth, logging) lives directly inside `@danypops/vehicle-server` and
`@danypops/vehicle-client`, not as a separate dependency they each pull in.

## Getting started

The fastest path to a working Vehicle-backed Pi extension is copying one of
three ready-made starter templates in [`templates/`](./templates) and
renaming it -- not reading this whole README and wiring `vehicle-core`/
`vehicle-server`/`vehicle-client-pi` together from scratch:

```bash
cp -r templates/job-orchestration ~/my-extension   # or templates/memory, or templates/chat-bridge
cd ~/my-extension && bun install && bun test
```

Pick by shape: **job-orchestration** and **memory** are Monolith Mode (no
daemon); **chat-bridge** is the daemon-backed Split shape. See
[`templates/README.md`](./templates/README.md) for the full comparison, and
"Split vs Monolith" below for the deployment-shape tradeoff itself.

## Why this exists

Four independent daemons (`web-spider-daemon`, `jittor`, `papyrus`,
`pi-packed`) each hand-rolled the same problem: an XDG-path-resolved,
Bearer-token-authenticated, loopback-only Bun service backed by SQLite, with
a typed RPC client on the other end. Two of the four originals' own header
comments admitted the duplication ("mirrors jittor/src/state.ts exactly").
This workspace is that shared substrate, factored out after the fact once
four real implementations existed to compare, and later merged directly into
the Vehicle server/client packages once it became clear that substrate
*is* what a Vehicle server and client actually are -- not infrastructure a
Vehicle happens to depend on.

Vehicle's own operation-invocation layer (descriptors, schema codecs, failure
shapes, permissions, idempotency, deadlines, cancellation, progress) is kept
in a separate zero-dependency `vehicle-core` package: a real npm package with
its own version and its own `exports` map, not a barrel re-exporting
unrelated concerns under one bundle. A consumer that only needs
`VehicleRegistry` never pulls in an HTTP client or a Pi projection it isn't
using.

## Workspace layout

| Package | Depends on (workspace) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `@danypops/vehicle-core` | -- | Vehicle's wire contract: operation descriptors, schema codecs, failure shapes. Zero runtime dependencies, zero Bun-specific code. |
| `@danypops/armada` | -- | Reconciles a user-scoped Vehicle fleet through systemd, launchd, or Windows Task Scheduler. Native service managers own processes; Armada owns desired state and descriptors. |
| `@danypops/vehicle-server` | `armada`, `vehicle-core` | The daemon itself: process lifecycle, SQLite storage bootstrap, structured logging, HTTP auth/RPC scaffolding, Armada service projection, credential vault, process supervision -- plus `VehicleRegistry` (execution engine) at `.` and its authenticated HTTP hosting surface at `./http`. See its own module table below. |
| `@danypops/vehicle-client` | `vehicle-core`, `vehicle-server` | Every way to reach a Vehicle server: `LocalVehicleClient` at `./local`, `RemoteVehicleClient` at `./http`, plus the generic connection-resilience toolkit (retry, auto-spawn policy, version check, push-channel reconnection, RPC over HTTP or a Unix socket) any client needs. See its own module table below. |
| `@danypops/vehicle-client-pi` | `vehicle-core`, `vehicle-server` | Projects any `VehicleClient` into native Pi tools, with live availability curation, plus the rest of this house's Pi-extension-facing surface: jiti-load-safety verification and the shared `/secrets` command. |
| `@danypops/vehicle-conformance` | `vehicle-core`, `vehicle-server` | Host-neutral `bun:test` conformance suite any `VehicleClient` implementation must satisfy identically. Ships raw TypeScript -- a test-time devDependency, not a runtime library. |

The tables below are the hand-maintained, narrative version of this layout --
why each module exists, what it replaced, and the design rationale behind it.
For the mechanical, always-current version (every real export, its exact
signature, and its own TSDoc description where seeded) generated straight
from source, see **[`docs/api/`](docs/api/README.md)** -- run `npm run docs` to regenerate it after changing an export. `@danypops/vehicle-conformance` is deliberately excluded (test-time-only, per its own row above).

## `@danypops/vehicle-server` modules

Each module is independently importable (`@danypops/vehicle-server/paths`,
etc.) so a consumer only pulls in what it uses.

| Module | Replaces | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `paths` | each daemon's `state.ts` | Cross-platform path resolution (Linux: XDG; macOS: ~/Library/Application Support etc.; Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/%APPDATA%), cross-checked in tests against `env-paths` without taking it as a runtime dependency. Single-instance lock (`acquireDaemonLock`/`releaseDaemonLock`, atomic wx-create with dead-pid theft) so exactly one daemon process ever binds. Auth token load-or-create, atomic daemon handle write/read/remove. Loopback-only is a hard invariant here, not a per-daemon option. |
| `storage` | each daemon's `db.ts` | bun:sqlite bootstrap: `foreign_keys`, `busy_timeout`, `journal_mode=WAL`, `optimize`, and a `PRAGMA user_version` migration runner. The version-gap/downgrade-checking migration engine (`runMigrations`) is generic over a small `SqliteMigrationRunner<Handle>` port, so a storage layer that isn't bun:sqlite-shaped (e.g. node:sqlite, or a project's own dual-runtime `Db` abstraction) can reuse it via its own adapter, without editing this module. |
| `logging` | each daemon's `log.ts` (or lack of one) | Structured, credential-safe logging backed by pino, preserving the pre-existing string-level JSON shape so existing log consumers keep working. `createLogger()` configures pino's own `redact` (fast-redact under the hood) with a shared default list of credential-shaped field names (`password`/`token`/`accessToken`/`refreshToken`/`apiKey`/`secret`/`authorization`/`credential`, at the root and one level deep via `*.<field>`) censored at serialization time regardless of what a call site logs -- `additionalRedactPaths` appends a consumer's own domain-specific paths without redeclaring the shared list. Every log line emitted during an inbound RPC call automatically carries an `rpcCallId` field (see `rpc-correlation`) -- no call-site change needed. |
| `rpc-correlation` | nothing (new) | `runWithRpcCallId(id, fn)`/`getCurrentRpcCallId()`, backed by Node's `AsyncLocalStorage`. `startDaemon()`'s own Bun/Node listeners and `serveUnixRpc()`'s own frame dispatch each bind a fresh `randomUUID()` around their single per-request dispatch call, so every `logger.*` call made anywhere during that request -- however many `await`s deep -- carries the same `rpcCallId`, read automatically via `logging.ts`'s own pino `mixin`. A correlation id, not distributed tracing: these are single-hop, loopback-only daemons, not a network of services propagating trace context across hops. Deliberately not named `correlationId` or `operationId` -- both already name a different, real concept in `@danypops/vehicle-core` (a caller-supplied id spanning many `invoke()` calls, and one Vehicle operation invocation's own cancellation-tracking id, respectively); `rpcCallId` identifies one raw inbound request at the transport layer regardless of whether it turns out to be a Vehicle operation call at all. |
| `rpc-http` | each daemon's `service.ts` auth/health scaffolding | Bearer-token check, JSON/error/health/ready response helpers. Deliberately not a routing framework -- each daemon has a handful of routes, too few to justify one. Also backs `VehicleRegistry`'s own `./http` provider directly. |
| `session-identity` | ad hoc, unverified session-id fields (new) | First-touch capability binding for daemon operations where a caller-supplied session id becomes behavior-affecting, not just an audit label -- a shared bearer token cannot distinguish which client is calling, so a session id alone is not a credential. Storage-agnostic: owns the crypto primitive and a store interface, not a schema. |
| `daemon` | each daemon's `daemon.ts` | Composition root: acquire the single-instance lock before binding anything (a losing concurrent start rejects with `DaemonAlreadyRunningError` and never binds a port -- runDaemonProcess() treats that as a normal join, exit 0, not a crash), bind loopback:0, write the handle only after a successful bind, run periodic maintenance tasks (failures logged, never silently swallowed, never crash the daemon), idle-timeout self-shutdown, clean SIGINT/SIGTERM. **Runtime-dual**: Bun (`Bun.serve`) or plain Node (`node:http`), runtime-detected the same way `storage.ts` already does for SQLite -- `buildApp()`'s `{ fetch(Request): Promise<Response> }` contract is already Web-standard, so nothing above that layer changes; verified against a real spawned `node` process, not just at the type level. `pushChannel` (see `push-channel`) requires Bun (WebSocket upgrade) -- passing one under Node rejects with an actionable error rather than silently degrading. `startDaemon()` is always async (Node's `listen()` cannot bind synchronously the way `Bun.serve()` does). Idle shutdown defaults from an env-provided launch provenance (auto-spawned vs. service-installed) unless an explicit `idleBudgetMs` is given. `runDaemonProcess()` adds the real binary's signal wiring. Shipped pre-compiled (`./daemon` -> `dist/daemon.js`, bundled with `paths`/`rpc-http`/`logging`/`push-channel`) via `bun run build:daemon` -- Node refuses to type-strip *any* `.ts` file under `node_modules` (a permanent policy, confirmed directly against Node's own docs, not a missing flag), and a real consumer's own `tsc` build has no `Bun` global type available -- both real blockers for a plain-Node consumer of raw source, both closed by compiling instead. |
| `service` | direct daemon-owned systemd, launchd, and Registry mutation | Projects bounded Vehicle declarations into Armada, then reconciles through the native service manager. Credentials and arbitrary environment values are rejected. Legacy descriptor renderers remain available for migration diagnostics but do not own installation. |
| `process-supervisor` | Enigma's own `src/supervisor.ts` (restart-policy interpretation, a credential-refresh restart, the shutdown contract) | `runProcessSupervisor()` builds on `supervisor.ts`'s minimal `spawnUnit()`: restart-policy interpretation (`always`/`on-failure`/`no`), a `shouldPlannedRestart` predicate checked on a timer that kills-and-relaunches bypassing restart policy entirely (for a reason other than a crash), an explicit `restartUnit(name)` escape hatch independent of that timer, and the shutdown contract (graceful shutdown -- see below -- to every unit, `stop()` resolves only once all have actually exited). `resolveEnv` is called fresh at every (re)launch, not once at supervisor start. Generic on purpose -- a caller's own secret resolution and freshness predicate are supplied as callbacks, never hardcoded here. |
| `supervisor` (graceful shutdown) | Enigma's own `process.on("SIGTERM", ...)` fixture/unit code, which silently doesn't work on Windows | `spawnUnit()`'s `requestGracefulShutdown()` sends a real SIGTERM on POSIX (unchanged), or -- on Windows, where `ChildProcess.kill("SIGTERM")` unconditionally terminates the process without ever invoking a handler -- writes a magic line to the unit's stdin instead (stdin is now piped, not ignored, specifically to make this possible). `awaitGracefulShutdown()` is the unit-side counterpart: a unit calls it once at startup to react identically to a real POSIX signal or the Windows stdin fallback, without needing its own platform branch. `platform` is injectable on `spawnUnit()` (mirroring `paths.ts`/`service.ts`'s own convention) so the Windows code path is exercised in CI on any host OS. |
| `vault` | pipes' token-provider.ts, pipes' per-backend file stores, tickets' token-store.ts | Shared OAuth/credential machinery for a daemon that authenticates to an external service on the user's behalf: plaintext (`createFileStore`) or AES-256-GCM-encrypted-at-rest (`createEncryptedFileStore`) per-backend token storage, and `createTokenProvider()` -- a `getToken()` an adapter calls before every request, sharing one in-flight refresh across concurrent callers so two racing refreshes never burn a single-use rotating refresh token. |
| `unix-peer-cred` / `unix-rpc-server` | nothing (new) | A Fetch-API-shaped RPC handler served over a Unix domain socket with the kernel-verified caller's SO_PEERCRED credential attached to every request -- Bun/node:http expose no peer credentials for Unix sockets, so this uses `Bun.listen()` for raw fd access and a custom newline-delimited JSON frame instead of real HTTP/1.1. |
| `version` | each daemon's `version.ts` | Reads the running version from the caller's own `package.json` -- the single release source of truth, never hand-duplicated or hardcoded. Also duplicated (unchanged) into `vehicle-client`, since a client-side consumer has no other reason to depend on this package. |
| `push-channel` | nothing -- Papyrus's Task widget could previously only poll on a fixed interval (new) | `PushChannel` wires an optional authenticated WebSocket upgrade into `startDaemon()` (`GET /push?token=...`, query-string token since the WebSocket constructor cannot set an Authorization header) alongside the existing fetch-based RPC. `publish(topic, payload)` broadcasts to every subscriber of that topic the moment a mutation happens, instead of every client waiting out a poll interval. Bounded connection count and topics-per-connection. Pairs with `vehicle-client`'s `connectPushChannel()`. Shipped pre-compiled (`./push-channel` -> `dist/push-channel.js`, built together with `daemon`) so a `PushChannel` built through this export shares one type identity with `startDaemon()`'s own `pushChannel` option. |

## `@danypops/vehicle-client` modules

| Module | Replaces | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `rpc-client` | each daemon's `client.ts` | Typed `AuthenticatedRpcClient<Op, Inputs, Outputs>`: `call(op, input)`, `operations()`, `health()`, `ready()` over a single Bearer-authenticated dispatch endpoint. |
| `daemon-client` | each Pi extension's own retrying-client copy (lector's `lectorClient()`, web-spider's `callWebSpider()`, papyrus's `callService()`, pi-packed's `createNatives()`) and their independently-forked auto-start policy | `createRetryingClient()`: caches a connected client and retries exactly once against a freshly reconnected one on a stale-connection error (the daemon rebinds a random port on every restart), and fails fast via a circuit breaker after sustained connect failures instead of paying a full connect timeout on every call. `connectWithPolicy()`: one explicit `autoStart` flag (default false, fail closed) instead of a silent per-daemon fork between failing closed and transparently spawning the daemon. `connectWithVersionCheck()`: detects a daemon left running from before an extension upgrade and transparently replaces it. `spawnDetachedDaemon()`: platform-correct spawn options (Windows console-hiding) for the four independent `spawn()` callbacks. `connectPushChannel()`: subscribes to a daemon's push-invalidation channel with real reconnection -- exponential backoff gated by a minimum-uptime window, jittered to avoid a reconnect storm when several Pi sessions reconnect to the same restarted daemon at once, plus a heartbeat ping/timeout to catch a socket that stays open while the daemon itself is hung. `createReconnectingVehicleClient(connect)`: wraps `createRetryingClient` as a drop-in `VehicleClient` -- pass it to `registerVehicleTools()` instead of a bare `new RemoteVehicleClient(...)` so a Pi session survives a daemon restart without a full extension reload. `manifest()` retries transparently (read-only, always safe); `invoke()` uses identity-aware `callOnce()` -- it invalidates a changed daemon before dispatch and retries only definitive pre-dispatch refusal/DNS failures, while a transport loss after possible dispatch is never replayed and surfaces as typed outcome-unknown with the operation ID. Has no RUNTIME imports of its own (fetch/Request/TypeError/AbortError/WebSocket are all global; the one VehicleClient type import is erased at compile time), so it loads safely under Node without a Bun runtime -- shipped pre-compiled via `bun run build:daemon-client` anyway, since Pi's jiti loader has a real, demonstrated failure class importing a dependency's raw, unbuilt TypeScript. |
| `unix-rpc-client` | nothing (new) | Client counterpart to `vehicle-server`'s `unix-rpc-server`, same wire framing, built on `node:net` (not `Bun.connect`) so it works under Pi's own Node process. No identity material needed client-side -- SO_PEERCRED is kernel-enforced server-side. |

## Vehicle packages

`@danypops/vehicle-core` defines operation descriptors, schema codecs,
executable bindings, unique provider ownership, structured failures,
permissions, idempotency requirements, deadlines, cancellation, progress, and
request/response bounds. The serializable descriptor stays separate from
executable code. Zero runtime dependencies.

`@danypops/vehicle-server`'s root export is `VehicleRegistry`: registration,
permission/deadline/payload enforcement, an execution policy hook, and
`setAvailability(name, version, available, reason?)`, which toggles a
registered operation's usability at runtime (e.g. a credential got configured
or removed) -- there's no unregister, an operation's shape is permanent once
registered, only whether `manifest()` reports it `available` and whether
`invoke()` accepts it. Its `./http` export, `createVehicleHttpApp()`, exposes a
registry over `GET /vehicle/manifest`, `POST /vehicle/invoke` (JSON by default,
Server-Sent Events when `Accept: text/event-stream` -- needed for progress),
and `POST /vehicle/cancel`, Bearer-authenticated via this same package's own
`./rpc-http`. Kept as a separate subpath from the root export on purpose: a
consumer that only builds/tests a registry never pulls in HTTP request/response
plumbing.

`@danypops/vehicle-client` has no root export -- `./local` (`LocalVehicleClient`,
a same-process client wrapping a `VehicleRegistry` directly) and `./http`
(`RemoteVehicleClient`, authenticated HTTP with the same semantics as local)
are each a real, independent way to reach a `VehicleClient`; importing one must
never pull the other in. `RemoteVehicleClient` accepts an opt-in
`manifestCacheTtlMs` (default off -- every `manifest()` call hits
`/vehicle/manifest` fresh, today's exact behavior): when set, a call within
the TTL is served from a single cached slot instead of a new HTTP round trip,
and the cache is invalidated automatically the moment a non-`"read"`-effect
`invoke()` through that same client succeeds -- looked up against the cached
manifest itself, never a fresh fetch, so an operation this client has never
seen via `manifest()` is left alone rather than guessed at.

`@danypops/vehicle-client-pi` projects a `VehicleClient` manifest into native
Pi tools. It preserves exact operation versions, schemas, cancellation, Pi
call/session identity, explicit permissions and principals, keyed idempotency,
progress, and structured failures. A gated-effect operation (see "Approval
Gate" below) requires a real, verified approval capability -- opt-in per
deployment, never forced on a Vehicle that never configures it. A currently-unavailable operation (per the
manifest's `available` flag) -- or one whose declared `permissions` aren't
fully covered by this registration's own `options.permissions`, the exact
superset check `VehicleRegistry.invoke()` already enforces at call time,
applied here to visibility instead -- is still registered as a Pi tool -- Pi
has no `unregisterTool()` -- but curated out of the LLM's active/callable set
from the very first `registerVehicleTools()` call via its own
`syncManagedActiveTools` primitive (Vehicle-agnostic, exported separately for
any Pi extension curating its own tool visibility, not just this one). A
caller never sees a tool it has no permissions to call in the first place --
a wasted turn is the mild failure mode a pure invoke-time check leaves open;
the tool's mere presence in the system prompt, leaking the existence of a
capability the caller was never meant to know about, is the one this closes.
`refreshVehicleToolAvailability()` re-fetches the manifest on whatever
cadence the caller chooses (a maintenance-task interval, a push notification,
a session_start recheck) and re-syncs active/inactive state for known tools --
including permission eligibility, so a caller whose granted permissions
change mid-session (a token upgrade, a delegated-scope change) gets tools
revealed/hidden correctly without a full extension reload --
registering any genuinely new operation for the first time.

The same package also carries the shared `/secrets` Pi command
(`secrets-backend`, `secrets-backend-env`, `secrets-backend-local`,
`secrets-registry`, `secrets-tui`): a `SecretsBackend` port (`list`/`get`
redacted `SecretRecord`s, `rotate`/`revoke`, and `reveal` -- the one
deliberate unredacted exception, refused outright outside a real interactive
TUI session), an env-var backend and a `vehicle-server`-vault-backed local
backend, and a process-wide registry so several Pi extensions sharing one
session (Enigma, Pipes, Tickets) merge into one `/secrets` command instead of
each registering its own.

`@danypops/vehicle-conformance`'s `runVehicleClientConformance()` runs one
shared assertion suite -- manifest accuracy, input validation, permissions,
real handler failures, keyed idempotency, byte bounds, not-found,
progress-before-result ordering, cancellation, deadlines, close() -- against
any `VehicleClient` a fixture supplies. Caught a real bug live:
`LocalVehicleClient.manifest()` threw synchronously instead of rejecting after
`close()`, unlike its own `invoke()` and `RemoteVehicleClient.manifest()` --
exactly the kind of drift a shared suite catches and two separate test files
wouldn't.

### Tool Shell rendering boundaries

Vehicle keeps five contracts separate so changing a terminal view cannot alter
what the model reads or cause an application response to be persisted forever:

1. **Application DTO** -- the provider's validated operation output. Its
   `maxResponseBytes` is a transport limit, not a transcript or session budget.
2. **Model content** -- semantic, ANSI-free `VehicleContentBlock` text selected
   from `output.content` (or bounded JSON fallback). The Pi adapter defaults to
   a 16 KiB UTF-8 budget, configurable with `modelContentMaxBytes`; truncation
   reports omitted bytes and `complete=false`.
3. **Persisted presentation details** -- a JSON-safe, versioned, independently
   bounded human DTO. The generic `vehicle.tool-details/v1` projection caps
   total bytes, rows, columns, field text, and previews before Pi persists it;
   it never stores the raw application DTO or credential-shaped output fields.
4. **Interactive component** -- `renderResult` strictly parses persisted
   details and may collapse/expand only that already-bounded DTO. Malformed or
   unknown details fail closed to model content. Historical `{vehicle, output}`
   rows remain readable during the compatibility window.
5. **CLI presenters** -- host-specific stdout/stderr formatting over the
   application DTO. It is neither Pi model content nor persisted TUI state and
   owns its own output bounds.

A custom Pi presentation uses `presentations(descriptor)` to return a paired
`projector` (required `maxBytes`, `project`, optional transient
`projectProgress`) and `renderResult`. Projection runs after a successful
invocation and any interactive follow-up but before the result is returned to
Pi. A projection exception fails closed without persisting raw output; the
application mutation, if any, has already happened and is not rolled back.
Expanded/collapsed rendering never changes `content` or `details`.

Input call rows are schema-aware: standard `writeOnly` and password format plus
`x-vehicle-presentation: "omit" | "summarize"` control human display
recursively. The shared credential-name vocabulary is defense in depth, never
the only contract.

## Use a Vehicle from a Pi extension

```ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";
import { registerVehicleTools } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi";
import { createIssuesVehicleClient } from "./issues-client.js";

export default async function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  const client = createIssuesVehicleClient();
  await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, {
    permissions: ["issues:read"],
    principal: { id: "pi-extension" },
    closeClientOnSessionShutdown: true,
  });
}
```

Register from an async extension factory. Pi awaits the factory before replaying
the transcript, so historical tool rows receive their custom renderers after a
restart or `/reload`. Pi action methods are not available during extension
loading; `registerVehicleTools()` registers definitions immediately and defers
only active-tool synchronization to `session_start`.

Operation names are projected to Pi-safe names (`issues.search`
becomes `issues_search`); multiple versions receive `_vN` suffixes. Existing or
projected name collisions fail before any tool is registered. Supply
`resolveInvocation` when an operation needs per-call revisions, delegated
permissions, or an approval capability minted by an authority.

An operation the provider currently can't service (e.g. `jira_search` before
any Jira credential is configured) is still registered, so it can be revealed
later without Pi's missing `unregisterTool()` getting in the way, but it starts
*inactive* -- invisible to the LLM's tool-calling surface from turn one, not a
call that fails. Reflect a later change (a credential got configured or
removed) with `refreshVehicleToolAvailability()`. The underlying primitive,
`syncManagedActiveTools(pi, managedToolNames, desiredActiveToolNames)`, lives
in `@danypops/vehicle-client-pi` itself: Pi's `setActiveTools()` replaces the
*whole* active set, so a naive "hide my tool" call would silently disable
every other extension's tools and the user's own `--tools` flag along with
it. It reads the current active set first and only adds/removes names within
the caller's own `managedToolNames`, leaving everything else untouched, and
skips the call entirely when nothing would actually change:

```ts
import { refreshVehicleToolAvailability } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi";

let registered = await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, { permissions: ["issues:read"] });
setInterval(async () => {
  registered = await refreshVehicleToolAvailability(pi, client, registered, { permissions: ["issues:read"] });
}, 30_000);
```

On the provider side, mark an operation unavailable (or available again) on
`VehicleRegistry` directly -- `registry.setAvailability("jira.search", 1, false, "no Jira credential configured")`
-- and the next `refreshVehicleToolAvailability()` call picks it up.

### Split vs Monolith: two equally first-class deployment shapes

Everything above assumes the **Split** shape: `VehicleRegistry` runs in a
separate daemon process, a Pi extension talks to it over HTTP via
`RemoteVehicleClient`. That's the right choice whenever a Vehicle's state
must survive a Pi session ending, or several sessions/processes need to share
one provider. It is not the only choice, and Vehicle should never force it on
a consumer that doesn't need it -- Vehicle is boilerplate, not a framework.

**Monolith** is the other first-class shape: no daemon, no HTTP, no port, no
systemd unit. The provider and its one consumer share a process --
`createMonolithVehicle` (`@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/monolith`) bundles a
fresh `VehicleRegistry`, a `LocalVehicleClient` wrapping it directly (zero
network), and `registerVehicleTools()` projecting its operations onto real Pi
tools, into one call:

```ts
import { createMonolithVehicle } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/monolith";
import { defineVehicleOperation, bindVehicleOperation, defineVehicleSchema } from "@danypops/vehicle-core";

pi.on("session_start", async () => {
  await createMonolithVehicle(pi, { name: "echo-vehicle", version: "1.0.0", description: "..." }, (registry) => {
    const echo = defineVehicleOperation({ name: "echo.say", version: 1, /* ...same shape as any daemon-backed operation... */ });
    registry.register("echo", bindVehicleOperation(echo, () => async (context) => ({ text: context.input.text })));
  });
});
```

A Monolith provider's own operations are defined exactly the same way a
daemon-backed one's are (`defineVehicleOperation`/`bindVehicleOperation`
against the same `registry.register()`) -- upgrading to a real daemon later
means moving that same `register` callback into a service process and
swapping `LocalVehicleClient` for `RemoteVehicleClient`, not rewriting any
operation. See `packages/vehicle-client-pi/examples/monolith-echo-extension.ts`
for a complete, runnable extension (`pi --extension ./monolith-echo-extension.ts --print "..."`
works with nothing else running).

**When to pick which:**

| | Split (daemon + HTTP) | Monolith (in-process) |
|---|---|---|
| State must outlive the Pi session | Yes -- this is the whole point | No -- gone when the session ends |
| Multiple sessions/processes share one provider | Yes | No -- one process, one consumer |
| Setup | A daemon, a port, a systemd unit (or manual start) | Nothing -- just the extension |
| Upgrade path | N/A -- already the durable shape | Move `register()` into a daemon, swap the client |

### Surviving a daemon restart

`registerVehicleTools()` captures whatever `VehicleClient` you pass it forever,
in every registered tool's closure. A daemon binds a new random port on every
restart (crash, upgrade, manual `systemctl restart`); a bare
`new RemoteVehicleClient({baseUrl, token})` built once at `session_start` has no
way to notice its `baseUrl` is now dead. **Confirmed live**: every Vehicle tool
call in an already-running Pi session failed with a bare connection error
until the whole extension reloaded. Pass `createReconnectingVehicleClient()`
(`@danypops/vehicle-client`) instead:

```ts
import {
  createReconnectingVehicleClient,
  daemonInstanceIdentity,
} from "@danypops/vehicle-client/daemon-client";
import { RemoteVehicleClient } from "@danypops/vehicle-client/http";

const resolveTarget = () => resolveCurrentVehicleTarget();
const client = createReconnectingVehicleClient(
  async () => {
    // Re-resolve the daemon's CURRENT handle (host/port/token) on every
    // reconnect attempt -- a value captured once outside this factory would
    // reintroduce the exact bug this fixes.
    const target = await resolveTarget();
    return new RemoteVehicleClient({ baseUrl: target.baseUrl, token: target.token });
  },
  {
    // Never include the bearer token. Prefer the daemon's own instance UUID;
    // host+random port is a valid fallback when the handle has no UUID yet.
    resolveIdentity: async () => daemonInstanceIdentity((await resolveTarget()).baseUrl),
  },
);
await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, { permissions: ["issues:read"] });
```

Before every call, an optional `resolveIdentity` preflight compares the current
daemon instance with the client cache. A changed identity drops the old client
**before dispatch**, so an already-rewritten handle file does not require one
sacrificial failed tool call.

`manifest()` retries transparently -- always safe because it is read-only.
`invoke()` uses the stricter `callOnce()` policy. A definitive pre-dispatch
connection failure (`ECONNREFUSED`, DNS resolution failure, unreachable host in
the nested fetch cause chain) is retried once because no request reached the
daemon. A bare `fetch failed`, timeout, reset, or response loss remains
ambiguous: it is never replayed and surfaces as `MutationOutcomeUnknownError`
with the request's operation ID. If a definitive pre-dispatch failure persists
after the bounded retry, it surfaces as retryable
`PreDispatchConnectionError`. This preserves mutation safety while making the
common dead-random-port restart transparent.

### Approval Gate

`VehicleRegistry.configureApprovals()` is opt-in -- a Vehicle that never calls
it keeps today's exact `manifest()` shape and `invoke()` behavior (no gating
at all, no `vehicle.approval.resolve` operation, no `vehicle.approval.*`
events). Calling it turns on real, verified approval for a configurable set
of effects:

```ts
import { HmacApprovalAuthority } from "@danypops/vehicle-server/approval-authority";

registry.configureApprovals({
  // Defaults to ["destructive", "open-world"]. A ticketing/PR-facing Vehicle
  // can add "external-write" without forcing that requirement on every other
  // Vehicle in the ecosystem.
  requireApprovalForEffects: ["destructive", "open-world", "external-write"],
  authority: new HmacApprovalAuthority(), // default if omitted
  timeoutMs: 5 * 60_000, // default: how long a request stays resolvable
});
```

A gated `invoke()` with no capability (or an invalid one) never just fails
with a dead end: it durably records a `vehicle.approval.requested` Vehicle
Event first (operation, effect, principal, a bounded expiry), *then* throws a
retryable `approval-required` failure carrying the request's id. Any
authority -- a human at the same Pi session, a remote approver polling the
event stream, `@agentapprove/pi`-style phone approval -- resolves it via the
registry's own built-in `vehicle.approval.resolve` operation (permission:
`vehicle:approvals:resolve`), which mints a real HMAC-signed capability on
`"granted"` and nothing on `"denied"`. That capability is scoped to the exact
operation, version, and input it was requested for, expires with its
request, and is single-use -- presenting an arbitrary non-empty string (or a
capability minted for different input) is rejected outright, closing the gap
where any truthy string used to satisfy the check.

`registerVehicleTools()` wires the interactive half of this automatically:
when a Pi tool call gets back `approval-required` and `ctx.hasUI` is true, it
opens Vehicle's shared rich approval presenter (effect and formatted input,
approve/deny choices, optional comment, and explicit cancellation). The default
`approvalPresentation: "overlay"` is a blocking popup over scrollback;
`"integrated"` replaces the editor while preserving its exact draft, scrollback,
and footer. RPC/headless or partial UI implementations retain Pi's native
confirm fallback. The 2-minute timeout, abort, cancellation, and every UI error
all deny -- fail closed, never silently grant -- before retrying with whatever
capability `vehicle.approval.resolve` returns. No UI, or no requestId in the
failure, leaves the request durably pending for async/remote resolution instead
of eagerly denying it on the caller's behalf.

### Scheduler

`VehicleScheduler` (`@danypops/vehicle-server/scheduler`) is a distinct primitive from Vehicle Jobs: a Job tracks a unit of work already running; a Scheduler triggers something at a future time or on a recurring interval, independent of any job's own lifecycle.

```ts
import { VehicleScheduler } from "@danypops/vehicle-server/scheduler";
import { createFileVehicleSchedulePersistence } from "@danypops/vehicle-server/schedule-persistence";

const scheduler = new VehicleScheduler(registry, {
  persistence: createFileVehicleSchedulePersistence({ filePath: "schedules.json", fs }),
});
await scheduler.restore(); // call once at daemon startup, before serving any request

const handle = scheduler.schedule(
  "my-provider",
  { kind: "every", intervalMs: 60_000 }, // or { kind: "at", at: someEpochMs } for a one-shot
  { kind: "operation", name: "issues.sync", version: 1, input: {}, permissions: ["issues:write"] },
);
handle.cancel();
```

A fired action is always declarative -- invoke a named Vehicle operation or
emit a named Vehicle Event -- never a bespoke callback closure, so it
survives a restart. `restore()` re-arms every persisted entry: a one-shot
that fell overdue while the daemon was down fires as soon as possible (the
one thing it was supposed to do is never silently lost); a recurring entry
resumes its normal cadence from now rather than firing once per missed
tick. Bounded per owner the same way `WatchRegistry` bounds watches per
scope -- `VehicleScheduleLimitExceeded` once an owner's cap is hit.

### Activity Broker

A cross-extension, best-effort side channel for structured telemetry -- ported from vstack's (github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack) `pi-background-tasks` activity broker. Completely decoupled from the chat transcript: a Vehicle-projected Pi tool and a dashboard/logger extension never import each other, they just agree on one `globalThis` symbol and an event shape.

`registerVehicleTools()` publishes `vehicle.operation.started`/`completed`/`failed` events for every invocation automatically -- opt-in by construction, not by an option flag: publishing is a true no-op until some other extension actually registers a broker.

```ts
import { registerActivityBroker } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/activity-broker";

// In a dashboard/logger extension, once per process:
registerActivityBroker({
  publish(event) {
    if (event.severity === "error") logger.warn(event.summary, event.details);
  },
});
```

A broker's own `publish()` throwing, or no broker being registered at all, never affects the Vehicle tool call it's reporting on -- the same "activity publication is best-effort" contract vstack's original ships.

### `/safety` command

One place to see and control every registered Vehicle's projected-tool
policy (`allow`/`ask`/`blocked`), instead of it being scattered across each
Vehicle's own registration-time options. `registerVehicleTools()` and
`refreshVehicleToolAvailability()` contribute to a shared, process-wide
registry unconditionally -- the same "opt-in by construction" convention the
Activity Broker uses -- so `/safety` sees every Vehicle a session has
registered with zero extra wiring.

```ts
import { registerVehicleSafetyCommand } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/safety-command";
import { VehicleSafetyPolicyStore, createFileVehicleSafetyPersistence } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/vehicle-safety";

const policyStore = await VehicleSafetyPolicyStore.restore(
  createFileVehicleSafetyPersistence({ filePath: "safety.json", fs: createNodeAtomicJsonFsAdapter() }),
);
registerVehicleSafetyCommand(pi, policyStore);

// Pass the same store into every Vehicle's own registration so overrides
// actually take effect:
await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, { safetyPolicyStore: policyStore });
```

Each operation's state resolves by precedence: an explicit per-operation
override (a human's own `/safety` decision) always wins, then the
effect-level default (`requireApprovalForEffects`, mirroring the Approval
Gate's own set), then a missing permission blocks. An override winning over
a permission-based block only changes local visibility/gating -- it never
bypasses what the server actually authorizes; invoking a permission-blocked
operation a human overrode to `allow` still fails server-side with
`permission-denied`. An override of `ask` also gates `execute()` itself with the same shared local
approval presenter before ever calling `invoke()`, for an effect the effect-level
default wouldn't otherwise catch.

`/safety` Tab-cycles three views (All, Allowed, By effect) over every known
operation, built on Malevich's `TabbedContainer`/`Table`; editing closes the
panel and runs two short picks (which operation, then which new state) that
write through to the policy store -- effective the moment the affected
Vehicle's own next `refreshVehicleToolAvailability()` call re-reads it.

### Interactive follow-ups

A `registerVehicleTools()` option for the rare operation whose real UX needs
more than "call it, show the output" -- e.g. an operation that durably
records something and separately wants to offer a synchronous human
round-trip when `ctx.hasUI` allows one. Distinct from the Approval Gate's own
local-approval fast path (baked into every gated operation identically):
this is a per-operation, per-consumer escape hatch for a shape nothing else
shares.

```ts
await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, {
  interactiveFollowUps: (descriptor) =>
    descriptor.name === "discuss.open" || descriptor.name === "discuss.reply"
      ? async (_request, output, followUpClient) => {
          const question = (output as { rounds: { content: string }[] }).rounds[0]?.content;
          // ...show a local prompt, then optionally call followUpClient.invoke("discuss.reply", ...)
          return { content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }], output: { answered: true } };
        }
      : undefined,
});
```

Returning `undefined` (the default for every operation the resolver doesn't
name) falls back to the operation's own default content/details -- zero
behavior change for every consumer that never sets this option. A thrown
error propagates as a real tool failure; the primary `invoke()` already
succeeded and is never rolled back.

Pair it with `executionMode` when the follow-up prompts a human
synchronously -- `"sequential"` stops the model from batching that call
alongside other tool calls in the same turn and letting those run before the
human sees the prompt:

```ts
await registerVehicleTools(pi, client, {
  executionMode: (descriptor) => (descriptor.name === "discuss.open" ? "sequential" : undefined),
});
```

### Reload-safe widget state

A Vehicle-projected Pi widget's own local rendering state (which row is
selected, which panel is expanded, ...) must not be lost when the user
reloads or the conversation compacts -- a distinct concern from Vehicle
Jobs' own state (a background operation surviving a *daemon* restart) or
Vehicle Watchers (reacting to a remote resource's changes). This is
specifically the widget's own local UI state, in this process.

`createReloadSafeWidgetState` (`@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/widget-state`)
combines two independently-proven strategies behind one API instead of
making a widget author choose and hand-roll either: a durable sidecar file
(the shared atomic-JSON writer, unbounded -- the canonical source), plus a
bounded, fingerprint-deduped copy appended to the session's own branch via
`pi.appendEntry()` (a fallback replay path via `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()`
for when the sidecar is missing or corrupt -- a fresh checkout, a sidecar
deleted out-of-band):

```ts
import { createReloadSafeWidgetState } from "@danypops/vehicle-client-pi/widget-state";
import { createNodeAtomicJsonFsAdapter } from "@danypops/vehicle-server/atomic-json";

const taskOverlayState = createReloadSafeWidgetState<{ selectedId: string; expanded: boolean }>({
  key: "papyrus.task-overlay",
  filePath: "/path/to/task-overlay-state.json",
  fs: createNodeAtomicJsonFsAdapter(),
});

// Whenever the widget's own state changes:
await taskOverlayState.save(pi, { selectedId: "task-42", expanded: true });

// On session_start (or whenever the widget first mounts):
const restored = await taskOverlayState.load(ctx.sessionManager);
```

The sidecar carries the real state in full, with no size bound of its own;
only the session-branch copy is bounded (`maxEntryBytes`, default 64KB) --
past that it degrades to a small pointer (`{truncated: true, sizeBytes}`)
rather than ever risking a `/resume` crash from an oversized session entry.
Replaying from a truncated pointer recovers only that pointer, not the real
state -- the sidecar is what a widget author should treat as authoritative.

## One operation per real action, never an action-dispatch tool

A recurring anti-pattern in agent tool design -- documented independently as
"God Parameters"/"Kitchen Sink tool" (IBM's MCP integration guidance, several
agent-tooling blogs) and covered in Anthropic's own writing-tools-for-agents
post -- is one tool with an `action` enum branching into many otherwise-
unrelated operations, backed by a shared parameter blob that's a superset
union across every branch. A real audit of this house's own Pi tools found
exactly this shape at real scale: a 38-action, 33-parameter tool with its
`action` field left completely unconstrained (`Type.String()`, not even an
enum), so an invalid action isn't rejected until it reaches the daemon.

Define every real action as its own `VehicleOperation` instead, each with its
own honest `effect`/`idempotency`/schema -- never an operation whose own
input schema is itself an `action`-dispatch blob. This isn't just a style
preference: `VehicleOperationDescriptor` requires exactly one `effect` per
operation, so folding a destructive action (delete) and a read action (list)
behind one shared `action` parameter forces a dishonest blended `effect` --
either reads get gated as destructive, or deletes slip through ungated.
There's no equivalent cost to doing this with a raw `pi.registerTool()` call,
which is exactly how the anti-pattern accumulates unchecked.

Namespace many related operations under one provider with a shared dotted
name prefix (`tasks.create`, `tasks.list`, `tasks.remove`, ...) rather than
collapsing them into one tool -- `registerVehicleTools()`'s existing name
projection already turns this into distinct, correctly prefixed Pi tools
(`tasks_create`, `tasks_list`, `tasks_remove`) with no extra code, and two
providers using the same short action words (`notes.create` vs
`tasks.create`) never collide. This is the same "namespacing" alternative to
consolidation Anthropic's own guidance recommends, not something novel to
Vehicle. Proven at the scale that actually motivates reaching for a
mega-tool in `packages/vehicle-client-pi/test/namespaced-operations-at-scale.test.ts`,
which models a real 38-action tool this way and checks every operation
projects to a distinct, collision-free tool with its own narrow schema and
honest effect intact.

## What this deliberately does not include

- A routing framework (Hono, itty-router, tRPC): the auth/health/ops routing
  each daemon needs is a handful of `if` branches; a framework would add more
  surface than it removes.
- A replacement for the SQLite migration runner's shape: `PRAGMA user_version`
  is small, already proven across three of the four daemons, and has no known
  bug class a heavier tool (kysely, umzug) would fix.
- A root barrel re-exporting every package's surface as one bundle: each
  package's own `exports` map is the intended granularity -- import the
  specific subpath a consumer actually needs, not a merged blob of registry,
  HTTP client, and Pi projection code together.

## Status

`packages/vehicle-server/test/walking-skeleton.test.ts` covers bind, auth,
migration, dispatch, maintenance, and shutdown for the daemon substrate.
`packages/vehicle-server/test/vehicle-registry.test.ts` covers the runtime-neutral
`VehicleRegistry`, including `setAvailability()`; `packages/vehicle-client/test/`
covers `LocalVehicleClient` and `RemoteVehicleClient`+HTTP provider parity;
`packages/vehicle-conformance/test/` runs the same shared assertion suite
against both; `packages/vehicle-client-pi/test/vehicle-pi.test.ts` covers the
Pi-native tool projection, including initial active-set curation and
`refreshVehicleToolAvailability()`; `packages/vehicle-client-pi/test/pi-tool-availability.test.ts`
covers the underlying `setActiveTools()` union/diff primitive in isolation.
