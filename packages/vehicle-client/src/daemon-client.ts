/**
 * Generalizes the retry-once-on-stale-connection wrapper independently
 * reimplemented in lector's `lectorClient()`, web-spider's `callWebSpider()`,
 * papyrus's `callService()`, and pi-packed's `createNatives()` -- one Pi
 * extension-facing seam every consumer daemon needed and none of them
 * shared. A daemon binds a new random port on every restart; a client
 * resolved once and cached for a whole Pi session would otherwise keep
 * calling a dead port until the extension reloaded. `createRetryingClient`
 * detects that on the failing call itself, drops the cached client, and
 * retries exactly once against a freshly reconnected one.
 *
 * Shipped pre-compiled (see the package's `build:daemon-client` script and
 * its `./daemon-client` export) rather than raw TypeScript like the rest of
 * this package -- this is the one module here meant to be imported directly
 * by a Pi extension rather than by another Bun daemon, and Pi's jiti-based
 * extension loader has a real, demonstrated failure class importing a
 * dependency's raw, unbuilt TypeScript (see @danypops/vehicle-client-pi's
 * pi-load-harness.ts). This module has no RUNTIME imports of its own --
 * fetch/Request/TypeError/AbortError are all global -- so it is safe to
 * load under Node without a Bun runtime, and has no Pi-API dependency of
 * its own despite existing mainly for Pi extensions to reach a Vehicle server.
 * The one type-only import below (VehicleClient's shape, for
 * createReconnectingVehicleClient) is fully erased at compile time and
 * carries no runtime module resolution of its own.
 *
 * `connectWithPolicy` covers the other silent per-daemon fork found
 * alongside the retry duplication: whether a missing daemon should be
 * auto-started or fail closed. Both are legitimate policies (web-spider
 * auto-spawns; lector/papyrus/pi-packed fail closed) but were each
 * hardcoded per daemon instead of being a parameter of one shared helper.

 * gaps this closes:
 *
 * - `windowsHide: true` is required on win32 or a silent background
 *   auto-spawn pops a visible console window.
 * - SIGTERM is not a real signal on Windows: `child.kill("SIGTERM")` there
 *   terminates the process immediately rather than invoking a graceful
 *   shutdown handler, so a killed daemon's own cleanup (handle/lock removal)
 *   never runs. This function does not attempt to work around that --
 *   there is nothing a spawn-time option can do about a signal Windows
 *   doesn't implement. The single-instance lock's stale-pid recovery (see
 *   startDaemon) is the actual recovery path there, not graceful shutdown;
 *   this is stated here so no caller adds a Windows SIGTERM handler
 *   expecting it to reliably fire.
 *
 * The caller still owns `.unref()` on whatever handle its injected `spawn`
 * returns -- this function only shapes the options object, since detaching
 * the returned child handle is inherently spawn-implementation-specific
 * (node:child_process vs Bun.spawn expose that differently).

/**
 * A VehicleClient (@danypops/vehicle-core) that survives a daemon restart
 * without a full Pi extension reload. Confirmed live gap: registerVehicleTools()
 * (@danypops/vehicle-client-pi) captures one concrete VehicleClient forever in
 * every registered tool's closure -- when the daemon rebinds a new random
 * port (any restart), every tool call fails with a bare connection error
 * until the whole extension reloads and re-registers with a fresh client.
 * Passing `createReconnectingVehicleClient(connect)` instead of a bare
 * `new RemoteVehicleClient(...)` to registerVehicleTools() fixes this at the
 * one shared layer every Vehicle consumer already goes through, instead of
 * each hand-rolling its own reconnect wrapper.
 *
 * `connect` is re-invoked with the CALLER's own current target resolution
 * (e.g. re-reading a handle file for the daemon's latest port/token) --
 * this only works if `connect` itself re-resolves that target on each call,
 * not if it closes over one target captured at Pi session_start.
 *
 * manifest() is always safe to retry transparently (read-only, idempotent) --
 * uses call(), so a stale connection self-heals on the very next manifest
 * refresh (e.g. refreshVehicleToolAvailability()'s own periodic cadence)
 * with no visible failure to any caller.
 *
 * invoke() is deliberately NOT auto-retried: Vehicle's own idempotency model
 * (safe/keyed/unsafe) is real per-operation information this generic
 * wire-level wrapper has no way to safely generalize over (a keyed
 * operation's actual dedup, if any, lives in that operation's own handler,
 * not centrally in VehicleRegistry). Uses callOnce(), so a failed invoke()
 * still surfaces its real error to the caller exactly once -- never silently
 * double-invoked -- but the stale connection is dropped either way, so the
 * *next* invoke() (a model's natural retry after a tool error, or any other
 * call) reconnects and succeeds instead of failing forever.
