/**
 * Composition-root helper for a supervised, loopback-only daemon --
 * Bun-native (Bun.serve) or plain Node (node:http), runtime-detected
 * exactly like storage.ts already does for SQLite (bun:sqlite vs
 * node:sqlite via openRawDatabase). Generalizes the skeleton that was
 * identical (bind port 0, write the handle only after a successful bind,
 * run periodic maintenance timers, clean SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown) across
 * web-spider-daemon, jittor, and papyrus's daemon.ts -- two of which said
 * so in their own header comments.
 *
 * Mirrors jittor's own startDaemon()/serveMain() split, the most testable
 * of the four originals: startDaemon() does no process-level I/O beyond
 * binding a listener itself and returns a stoppable handle; runDaemonProcess()
 * adds the SIGINT/SIGTERM registration and process.exit for the real binary.
 *
 * startDaemon() is async under both runtimes -- Bun.serve() binds
 * synchronously, but node:http's listen() does not (the OS-assigned port
 * is only known once the 'listening' event fires), and this file has
 * exactly one entry point rather than a second parallel one callers must
 * choose between, so the Bun path pays the (negligible) cost of being
 * wrapped in a resolved Promise too.
 *
 * No consumer imports this module's startDaemon() directly outside this
 * package's own tests today, so this is not a breaking change to any real
 * caller -- confirmed directly, not assumed, before making the signature
 * change.
