/**
 * Wraps `registerVehicleTools` with the one step it never owned: resolving
 * the daemon target and building a client in the first place. That step is
 * inherently consumer-specific (each daemon has its own handle file/target
 * resolution), which is why it was never centralized here before -- but the
 * failure handling around it (silent return on no target, bare catch on any
 * error, no later retry) was reimplemented identically by every consumer
 * and always dropped the failure on the floor. This centralizes that
 * handling once: every step logs through `log` instead of vanishing, and a
 * daemon that is merely slow to start gets bounded retries (see
 * VehicleReadyRetryOptions) instead of a permanent zero-tools outcome for
 * the rest of the session.
 *
 * Registers one `session_start` handler that kicks off the resolve+register
 * sequence in the background (never blocks session_start itself on a
 * multi-attempt backoff) and returns a promise that settles once the
 * sequence either succeeds or exhausts its attempts -- awaiting it is
 * optional, useful mainly for tests and for a caller that wants to know the
 * final outcome (e.g. to show one status line) without polling.
 *
 * Every other `RegisterVehicleToolsOptions` field (including the opt-in
 * `shell` activation mode) passes straight through to the eventual
 * `registerVehicleTools` call unchanged.
