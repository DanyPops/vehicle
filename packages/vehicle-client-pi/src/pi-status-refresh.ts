/**
 * Wires the one status-refresh pattern every Vehicle-backed Pi extension
 * with a footer/widget ends up hand-rolling: refresh on session_start, and
 * refresh again whenever one of this extension's own projected tools just
 * ran (including an autonomous call the LLM makes mid-conversation, so a
 * human watching the footer and the model acting on the same state never
 * drift apart). A refresh failure (daemon not running, unreachable) is
 * swallowed -- a passive background repaint must never surprise-spawn a
 * daemon or surface an error for a widget nobody asked to see yet.
 *
 * Confirmed independently hand-copied at least three times before this
 * existed (pi-tickets, pi-papyrus, pi-jittor each pair their own
 * session_start/tool_execution_end handlers with their own tool-name-prefix
 * check and their own try/catch-and-ignore).
